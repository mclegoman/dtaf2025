**This project will release April 1st 2025.**

Theme: Space

The Mysterious Update (dtaf2025) focused on mystery/magic and friendlyness.
This year, I would like to go a different direction, something less friendly.

- Structure(s) with traps.
  - Could we make a trap that enchants the entity's items with a curse?
- Storyline.
  - I want the mod to be kind of similar to the potato update in that it has a "narrator".
    - I think this could be a good opportunity for some references to other games, such as portal or stanley parable.  
- Harder difficulty.
  - Again, I don't want this update to be friendly. I want the player to feel like they've accomplished something when completing this mod.
- Shaders.
  - I think the use of shaders in this update could be used to increase the difficulty.
    - e.g. Perspective's silhouette shader.
    - Maybe we could give the player a "buff" in return of us rendering a shader that makes it harder to see.  
- Entity Variants.
  - The potato update had potato mobs, with a system of where the potato mobs could infect the non-potato mobs.
  - What if we make our mob variants be harder, - e.g. stronger and if they hit you you get an effect - shader? - that way vanilla mobs still exist, but our harder variants would become more common. 

**Potential Ideas:**  
- 'Sonic' easter egg, if seed is equal to 'SONIC'. (Complete)
  - This is a reference to a bug when developing mclm_save, where the player's speed would be doubled.
- enchantment or easter egg that prevents the player from changing their pitch? (curse enchantment?)
  - Got this idea from a bug that prevented me from changing my pitch when attempting to add yaw correction to perspective.  


- Moon Dimension: Overworld in sky should be 80.0F (4x the size of the moon on the overworld)
- Space Dimension: Space Station. Earth should be bigger here, and the moon slightly bigger than the overworld.

### Goals
I would like to add variations to a bunch of the vanilla mobs.  
In dtaf2025, I only made the moobloom (and variants) due to a lack of time.

I would like to try and have variations of passive, neutral, and hostile mobs.
- A system that converts the vanilla mobs into the modded mobs.
  - And possibly a way to convert them back.
- Custom sounds for the variations.
